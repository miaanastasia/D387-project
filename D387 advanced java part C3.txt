Deploying this application to the cloud


To deploy this application to the cloud, I would use Microsoft Azure.  
First, create a resource and choose 'Container App.' Name the resource group and container appropriately based on the application,
in this case, the Landon Hotel app.  In the settings, uncheck 'quickstart image' and instead add the image name and tag (d387_mmit499:latest).
Enable ingress type HTTP and accept traffic from anywhere with the target port 8080.  Create the container and the app will deploy to the cloud.
Verify the site is live to ensure it will be accessible outside the local environment in which it was created.
